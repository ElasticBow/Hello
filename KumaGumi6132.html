Hey Lucifer, You are my favorite person, on an equal level to my immediate family, 
which says a lot and you have been above nutplant the whole time lol. 
You don't have to worry about me leaving you, im not stuck with you, you're stuck with me,
I'm like cancer, i'll stay with you until you die (not a threat). I don't know why you think
I would chose to ignore you when I want to hang out with you more than anyone else.
I'm so proud of you for who you've become and I'm so thankful you are still alive.
You never fail to make me happy and smile. I said this before but i'll say it again
and this time I don't care if you say it sounds flirty because at this point
it might as well be flirting, I love that I can make you smile because you deserve to be happy and just everything in general.
You're so special to me and thank you for everything you have done for me. 
I love you so much and always will, no matter what happens. :)

    <h1>If you want me to do the video you keep asking for tell me the code UKTAN and make sure that I hear it or see it if you send it in message.</h1>
