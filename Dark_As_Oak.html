    <h1>Dark As Oak's Page</h1>
    <h1>Hey Dark, I know we don't play that much anymore but you are a cool person to hang out with.
        You may not be my favorite anymore but I appreciate our time spent together. 
        You are very funny and I cherish our memories together, especially the ones with nut (we would make the perfect trio).
    </h1>
