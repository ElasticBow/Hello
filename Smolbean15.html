        Hey Smol, You might be annoying at times but you're still really fun to hang out with. 
        Even if I say mean things to you, you're still a great friend 
        and at the end of the day, I most likely don't mean what I said 
        and I'm glad that we are friends. Also remember, THE WORLD is your oyster, you control it, not the other way around.
    </h1>
