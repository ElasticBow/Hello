        Hello there Llama, you are an astonishing person. I like hanging out with you and you are genuinly intelligent. 
        You have played a pretty big role in my life and even if you don't think so, you are special (not special ed). 
        You are not worthless and I know you have gret potential to do something big in life.
        I know you're already optimistic but keep remembering that and continue being great.
        May the force be with you and stay with you forever.
    </h1>
