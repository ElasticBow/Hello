        Hey London, You're a wondeful person with a great personality. 
        You enlighten the mood of the group so much and just have a good, happy vibe all the time. 
        I can only imagine if you didn't suppress your emotions, you would be even better than you are now, and thats saying a lot. 
        Keep being you man, don't let your thoughts get to you.
    </h1>
