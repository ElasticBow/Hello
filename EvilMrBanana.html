Hey Banana, You are a very nice, kind, warmhearted person. 
Bro, how tf you keep your cool all the time and never got mad.
I've only ever seen you slighlty pissed off and you are literally the definition of a canadian.
We may not play as often anymore but I'll always remember our original factions day, 
when we weren't all split up and it was just me, you, dark, yoda, andrew, nut, and lucifer.
    </h1>
