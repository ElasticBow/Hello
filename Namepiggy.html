        Hey Name, you're a magnificent person and I enjoy being around you.
        You bring energy to the group and are a big part of the group. 
        Keep being yourself and enjoy what you do, don't let what others say get to you.
        You cannot give up... Name, stay DETERMINED and no matter what happens,
        you can't be scared, stay BRAVE. (Sorry for turning you into a sans fan).
    </h1>
