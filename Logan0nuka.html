    <h1>Hey Logan, I know we havn't known each other for long but you are a really good friend based on the time we have spent together. 
        I'm glad Kuma met you and intoduced me to you, and while you aren't one of my best friends, 
        the fact that I included you in this says a lot. 
        I'll care about you as long as we are friends and I hope nothing bad happens between us.</h1>
